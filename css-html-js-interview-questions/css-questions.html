Why do people use them? How does something like Compass relate to Sass?</h2>

<p>They are CSS preprocessors. They are an abstraction layer on top of CSS. They are a special syntax/language that compile down into CSS. They make managing CSS easier, with things like variables and mixins to handle vendor prefixes (among other things). They make doing best practices easier, like concatenating and compressing CSS.</p>

<p>Being good at googling problems you are having is a valuable job skill. There isn't any shame in it. There is shame in spinning your wheels because "you should know this." If you don't have time to do the Googling exercise above, just asking about resources can be telling.</p>

<p>Google is a pretty good answer <em>(since it's true and we all know it)</em>. But being able to name some specific sites is a good indicator they have done it a bunch and are familiar with the places they land and know their favorites. Stuff like MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) is a good answer.</p>

<p>Resets are so wildly common in CSS that anyone who is a front end developer type has surely used them. Do they do so blindly or do they know why? The reason is essentially that different browsers have different default styling for elements, and if you don't deal with that at all, you risk designers looking unnecessarily different in different browsers and possibly more dramatic breaking problems.</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-content-are-you-familiar-with-normalizecss-do-you-understand-how-they-differ" class="anchor" href="#are-you-familiar-with-normalizecss-do-you-understand-how-they-differ"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Are you familiar with normalize.css? Do you understand how they differ?</h3>

<p><a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Normalize</a> you might call a CSS reset alternative. Instead of wiping out all styles, it delivers a set of reasonable defaults. It doesn't unset things that are already consistent across browsers and reasonable <em>(e.g. bold headers)</em>. In that way it does some less than a reset. It also does some more than a reset in that it handles quirks you may never consider, like HTML5 audio element inconsistencies or line-height inconsistencies when you use sub and sup elements.</p>

<p><a href="http://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/">Floats</a> are still incredibly common. As this is published, still probably the most cross-browser consistent way to build layout and grids. Anyone who has worked with them is aware of float collapsing. That is, floated element do not add to the height of a parent element. So for example if a parent element contained only floated elements, it would collapse to zero height. You can deal with that like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a clearfix (bonus points for micro clearfix).</li>
<li>Float the parent as well.</li>
<li>Use an overflow property other than "visible" on the parent (bonus points for listing downsides like cutting off shadows).</li>

<p><strong>As a bonus question</strong>, you could ask them to compare using inline-block and floats for building a grid.</p>

<ul>
<li>Good answer: there are problems either way. With inline block you need to deal with the whitespace issue.
With floats you need to deal with clearing.</li>

<a name="user-content-what-are-possible-alternatives-to-sprites" class="anchor" href="#what-are-possible-alternatives-to-sprites"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What are possible alternatives to sprites?</h3>

<p><a href="http://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/">Sprites are</a> essentially multiple images combined into one. Performance is the reason that they are used. Generally speaking, the slowest thing a website can do is request a resource. The fewer requests a site needs to make, the faster it is. Fast = good. Combining what would be many requests into one = good.</p>

<p><a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/44dcc99e9edb78cf92d48866f9493c40d091ad42/687474703a2f2f6373732d747269636b732e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f637373747269636b732d75706c6f6164732f313435343238323639392d6c686e2d7370726974652e706e67" target="_blank"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/44dcc99e9edb78cf92d48866f9493c40d091ad42/687474703a2f2f6373732d747269636b732e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f637373747269636b732d75706c6f6164732f313435343238323639392d6c686e2d7370726974652e706e67" alt="Image Sprites" data-canonical-src="http://css-tricks.com/wp-content/csstricks-uploads/1454282699-lhn-sprite.png" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>Asking how they make sprites would just seal the deal that they are actually very familiar with them. Manually creating sprites is certainly a possibility but it isn't very efficent. There are helper tools like <a href="http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/105-using-spritecow/">SpriteCow</a> and <a href="http://spriteme.org/">SpriteMe</a>, <a href="http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/spriting/">Spriting with Compass</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon">Grunticon</a>. It's always interesting to hear a real workflow approach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sprites are raster images. When asking about alternatives, good answers might be related to the fact that sprites are often for icons and icons often don't need to be raster. <a href="http://simurai.com/post/20251013889/svg-stacks">SVG Stacks</a>, <a href="http://css-tricks.com/flat-icons-icon-fonts/">Icon Fonts</a>, <a href="http://copypastecharacter.com/">Unicode</a>...</p>

<p><a href="http://css-tricks.com/places-its-tempting-to-use-display-none-but-dont/">Hidden content</a> is a big one here. It's only acceptable to use display: none; if you're both trying to hide things visually and the content itself.</p>

<p>CSS controls colors so color <a href="http://colorfilter.wickline.org/">accessibility</a> is relevant. <a href="http://a11yproject.com/posts/never-remove-css-outlines/">Focus styles</a> are also important and directly controlled by CSS.</p>

<p>There is a lot more accessibility stuff that is related to HTML and JavaScript, so mentioning that stuff is great, but I think it's interesting to target the question solely on CSS to force focused thinking.</p>

<p>They should have some kind of strategy. Perhaps a web based tool like <a href="http://www.browserstack.com/">BrowserStack</a>. Perhaps a VM based tool like <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual Box</a>. Perhaps different actual computers.</p>

<p>It's about making websites work wherever the web is. Different devices with different sizes and different capabilities. Responsive design is about taking one code base and making it work for all of them. Part of that is media queries and different visuals. Part of that is different resources <em>(e.g. different JavaScript to handle touch vs click or different images to accommodate the screen)</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://css-tricks.com/using-svg/">SVG</a> is an image format that is vector based. It's an efficient format for that <em>(small file sizes)</em>.

<p>A non-leading way to get them to talk about <code>@font-face</code> and how it works. Talking about how it works as a core CSS technology is great, as well as talking about services that provide the fonts and can make it easier e.g. Google Fonts, Typekit, Font Deck, Cloud Typography, etc.</p>
